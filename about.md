This site is a personal blog about
[OSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) and Operating
Systems.

I'm working as Sr. System Administrator with experience in various
UNIX and UNIX-like Operating Systems such as FreeBSD and GNU/Linux -
Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, ArchLinux. I also have experience in
programming with C, Python, Shell scripting and SQL.

My interests are mainly related to
[OSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), Operating
Systems, Monitoring, Virtualization, Automation & Configuration
Management.

Favourite Operating Systems of choice:

* FreeBSD
* Arch Linux
* Debian GNU/Linux

I enjoy working on different projects and code stuff in C, Python and
Rust.
