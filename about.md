This site is a personal blog about [Open Source
Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software),
Operating Systems, Virtualization, Automation & Configuration
Management, Programming, and anything else that comes to my mind.

I have experience with various UNIX and UNIX-like
Operating Systems such as BSD and GNU/Linux.

Programming languages I am (or have been) coding include C, Python,
Go, Rust, Common Lisp, Scheme and Clojure.

I am also a proud father of two kids - Alexander and Karina, so
whenever I don't have any coding to do, I try to spend as much time as
I can with my kids. That's us here.
