This site is a personal blog about
[Open Source Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software),
Operating Systems, Virtualization, Automation &
Configuration Management.

I have experience in various UNIX and UNIX-like
Operating Systems such as FreeBSD and GNU/Linux -
Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, ArchLinux. I also have experience in
programming in C, Python, Rust and Shell scripting.

My interests are mainly related to

Operating Systems, Monitoring, Virtualization, Automation & Configuration
Management and these are the primary topics I like to write about in
this blog.

Favourite Operating Systems of choice:

* FreeBSD

I enjoy working on different projects and code stuff in C, Python and
Rust.
