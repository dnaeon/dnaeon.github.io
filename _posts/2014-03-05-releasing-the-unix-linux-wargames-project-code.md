Some time ago, I've started a project with educational purposes
called the `UNIX/Linux Wargames`.

The idea of the project was to allow people put their hands on a
UNIX/Linux system and learn new stuff -- that is how to use the OS
tools in order to do cool things and practice in general.

At the time I've started with the `UNIX/Linux Wargames Project` there
were other similar projects, but they were meant for programmers or
were strictly security oriented.

The `UNIX/Linux Wargames Project` I've started was meant for people
with little or no experience with UNIX/Linux systems and it's goal was
to introduce people to UNIX/Linux systems and the tools by solving
various challenges, or how we used to call them -- *chapters*.

By doing so, people were able to learn something new by solving
something practical.

Although there were other similar projects at that time, but with
different goals I had no real idea where to start from. You could find
various Wargames projects on the net, but there was nothing posted on
how to actually start a new Wargames project, so I was on my own.

So, I've started building the *chapters* -- and it took me some time
to come up with something interesting, presented like a game, but
eventually I made it. It was time let others know about it.

Soon after announcing the new `UNIX/Linux Wargames Project` there
was a big interest in it, and lots of people were playing it!

After solving a challenge people were able to publish their own
solutions to the *Wargames Knowledge Base*, so it was a good way to
actually share experience with others.

Few also made it to the *Wargames Hall Of Fame*!

Unfortunatelly due to various reasons
(ranging from malicious users, lack of resources, and others..) I had
to shut down this whole project after a while...

Few people knew that this was coming, but I never had the time to
actually post about it.

I've been thinking for a while about it, and thought that now is the
time to release the code I've used when I started the
`UNIX/Linux Wargames Project`.

I'm doing so with the hope that maybe some day it could serve as the
base or guideline for someone else's work when starting a new
Wargames project.

The code along with all chapters can be found at the Github
repository listed below.

Hope someone finds it useful when starting a new Wargames project.
