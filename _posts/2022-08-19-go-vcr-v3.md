A new version of [go-vcr ](https://github.com/dnaeon/go-vcr) has been
released today.

With `v3` of `go-vcr` some long standing issues have been fixed, the
API has been cleaned up, and additional utility methods for
introspecting the recorder have been added.

**NOTE**: This release is not backwards-compatible with previous
versions of the cassettes used by `go-vcr`. If you are upgrading to
`v3` you should re-create your test cassettes.

A summary of changes for this release:

  `ModeRecordOnce`, `ModeReplayOnly`, `ModeReplayWithNewEpisodes` and
  `ModePassthrough`. Please refer to the API documentation for more
  details on their use cases
- In order to create recorders with custom options you should use the
  `recorder.NewWithOptions` function from now on
- The default mode of the recorder is now `ModeRecordOnce`
- `ModeDisabled` has been removed and is now replaced by
  `ModePassthrough`
- Cassette format has been changed and the supported version of the
  cassette from now on is `v2`.
- Additional fields have been added to the cassette to allow
  developers to create more complex matchers based on the existing
  fields
- Each interaction in the cassette now has a unique integer id,
  specifying the position of the interaction in the cassette
- Utility method on the recorder can now return a pre-configured HTTP
  client with the recorder's transport - `GetDefaultClient()`
- CI/CD pipeline has been transferred to Github actions
- Closed out some long standing issues
