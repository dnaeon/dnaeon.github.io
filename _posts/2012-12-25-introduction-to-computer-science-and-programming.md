Yesterday, while browsing on the Net, I've stumbled upon the website
of [edX - The Future of Online Education](https://www.edx.org/).

[edX](https://www.edx.org/) offers free online courses from well known
universties like [MIT](https://www.edx.org/university_profile/MITx),
[Harvard University](https://www.edx.org/university_profile/HarvardX),
[University of California,
Berkley](https://www.edx.org/university_profile/BerkeleyX),
[University of Texas
System](https://www.edx.org/university_profile/UTx),
[Wellesley](https://www.edx.org/university_profile/WellesleyX) and
[Georgetown
University](https://www.edx.org/university_profile/GeorgetownX).

While looking at the free courses at [edX](https://www.edx.org/) one
grabbed my attention - [MITx 6.00x: Introduction to Computer Science
and
Programming](https://www.edx.org/courses/MITx/6.00x/2013_Spring/about). Below
follows a more detailed summary about the course itself, cited from
the [edX
website](https://www.edx.org/courses/MITx/6.00x/2013_Spring/about):

*"6.00x is an introduction to using computation to solve real
 problems. The course is aimed at students with little or no prior
 programming experience who have a desire (or at least a need) to
 understand computational approaches to problem solving. Some of the
 people taking the course will use it as a stepping stone to more
 advanced computer science courses, but for many, it will be their
 first and last computer science course."*

*"Since the course will be the only formal computer science course
 many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather
 than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction
 to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when
 they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some
 goal later in their career. That said, it is not a "computation
 appreciation" course. It is a challenging and rigorous course in
 which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend
 the computer to their will."*

*"Those who earn a passing grade will get an honor code certificate
 from MITx. Please see the edX FAQ for more information about
 certificates."*

Fascinating, isn't it? Wait, there's even more - the course will teach
you how to program in [Python](http://python.org/)!

Not sure about you, but to me that sounds pretty appealing. And guess
what, I've already signed up for the course which starts at February
next year! :)

Check out the free courses at [edX](https://www.edx.org/) and take the
course you like the most. I've already chosen mine! :)
