Today I've got my copy of [Programming
Algorithms](https://leanpub.com/progalgs), which is a book
about algorithms and data structures using Lisp.

This book is definitely a good addition to my Lisp books collection,
which I'm planning to read.

If you are into Lisp, I'd recommend buying that book, which is a great
way to support the author and the Lisp community in general.
