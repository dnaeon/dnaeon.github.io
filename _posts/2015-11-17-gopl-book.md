So, I've finally received my copy of
[The Go Programming Language](http://www.gopl.io/) by
Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan!

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gopl-book.jpg)

The book is nicely organized in a way similar to how
[The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)
was designed and after each chapter there are exercises, so that you
could to test your skills and understanding on the topic.

Considering the author's experience and background I have no doubts
that this book will quickly become one of my favourites and most
valuable resources on Go!
