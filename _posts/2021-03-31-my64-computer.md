I've always been fascinated by old retro computers, even though I
didn't have one, so it is hard for me to explain why I feel such a
connection with these old machines.

It was a couple of months ago when I was reading something about
[Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) and was
looking around to buy myself one of these 8-bit machines. That's when
I found out about [My Retro Computer](https://myretrocomputer.com/)
and was pleasantly surpised that they build and sell computer cases of
the famous Commodore-64 and VIC-20 machines.

Now, the nice thing about these computer cases is that you can
actually put a modern
[Mini-ITX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-ITX) motherboard, so I
pulled the trigger and ordered myself the My64 case.

Having the computer case it was time to think about the various
computer parts I need in order to build a modern computer within a
retro case. I also have two kids, so it will be a fun experience for
each of us to build a computer together.

And without further ado here is the full list of parts I've ordered.

* [My64 computer case](https://myretrocomputer.com)
* [ASRock J5040-ITX motherboard](https://www.mini-itx.com/~J5040-ITX)
* [picoPSU-90 12V Plug-in DC-DC ATX PSU](https://www.mini-itx.com/~PICOPSU-90)
* [80W AC Universal Adapter 12V 6.6A with 2.5/5.5mm DC Power Connector](https://www.mini-itx.com/~80w-ac)
* [Intel Wireless-Ac 9260, Key E WiFi module](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Wireless-Ac-9260-2230-Gigabit/dp/B079QH5KW1/)
* [IPEX MHF4 Antenna WiFi Cable for NGFF/M.2 WiFi/WLAN Card Module](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DB6ZG3B/)
* [Samsung 500GB 870 Evo SATA 2.5", SATA 6 Gb/s](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-500GB-Internal-MZ-77E500B-AM/dp/B08QBMD6P4/)
* [DDR4 SODIMM 8GB 2400MHz, Team Group Elite, CL16-16-16-39, 1.2V](https://www.amazon.com/TEAMGROUP-2400MHz-PC4-19200-SODIMM-Laptop/dp/B01HOM9IZ4/)
* [40cm Mini SATA Cable for SATA Slimline Optical Drives](https://www.mini-itx.com/~40CM-MINI-SATA)

So, once we had the machine assembled it was time to install the
operating system. We downloaded Debian GNU/Linux and my 6 year old son
took care of installing it with a bit of assistance from my side.

And here's the final result with my kids playing games on a modern
Commodore 64 computer.

Next thing we will do is to get
[VICE](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/) installed, so we can enjoy
some 8-bit magic.
