Version `v0.4.0` of [clingon](https://github.com/dnaeon/clingon) is
ready and tagged.

The highlights of this release are the support for [persistent
options](https://github.com/dnaeon/clingon#persistent-options), which
allows an option to be propagated from a parent command to all
sub-commands associated with it.

Besides this, `clingon` can now generate the
[Dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language))
representation for your app.

This is how the tree representation of the `clingon-demo` app looks
like.

[changelog](https://github.com/dnaeon/clingon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.org)
as well.
