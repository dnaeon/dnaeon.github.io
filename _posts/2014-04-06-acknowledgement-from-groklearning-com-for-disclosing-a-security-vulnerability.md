Some time ago I've been testing the security of
groklearning.com - a platform for online education using Python.

While doing that I stumbled upon a security vulnerability which lead
to getting me shell access to one of the nodes in the groklearning.com
cluster.

After discovering the vulnerability I've been working with the
Security Team at groklearning.com in order to identify the root cause
and eventually patch the security hole.

By doing that I got acknowledgement from groklearning.com for
responsibly disclosing a security vulnerability :)
